### Technologies used:

- [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)
- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)
- [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### Build the project to generate 
This step is only required the very first time

i ran into some config problems and running it multiple times seemed to solve some setup issues.

```
npm run build
```

### Run Eleventy

```
npm run start
```

ctr+c twice cancels this while keeping the terminal open in vscode.
